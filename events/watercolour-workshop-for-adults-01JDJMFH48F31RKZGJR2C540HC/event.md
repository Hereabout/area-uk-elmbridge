Enjoy two hours of art exploration in watercolour (and complimentary materials), where you will: 

- Develop your creativity (from any starting point)

- Learn how to build an piece of art from scratch

- Be free to experiment

- Work on your watercolour technique and general art skills. 

The focus of this class, led by artist Parul Tolentino, is to learn through play & experimentation, develop creativity, build confidence for making art, be mindful & have a lovely morning. 

Research has proven that there are beneficial outcomes from creating art regularly so join me weekly from September 2024 - December 2024
